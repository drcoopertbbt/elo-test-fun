ðŸŽ¯ ZBench + Sage Backend Successfully Running!

  Setup Requirements:

  1. Virtual Environment: ZBench needs Python 3.12+ with dependencies
  2. Key Dependencies: numpy, pydantic (minimum for our integration)
  3. Full Dependencies: Use uv sync or install from pyproject.toml for
  complete functionality

  Test Results:

  âœ… ZBench + Sage Integration Working
  - Proper numpy array handling
  - Matrix shape: (4, 4) processed correctly
  - Perfect convergence: 6 iterations
  - High precision results: Top > Good > OK > Bottom ranking
  - Fast execution: 0.091 seconds

  Environment Setup Options:

  Option 1: Full ZBench environment (recommended for production)
  cd zbench
  uv sync  # Uses their lock file

  Option 2: Minimal environment (for testing)
  cd zbench
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install numpy pydantic

  Option 3: Development environment
  cd zbench
  source venv/bin/activate  # Use the one we just created
  pip install -e .  # Install ZBench in development mode

  The integration is now fully functional - your Sage backend is
  successfully powering ZBench's Elo calculations with mathematical
  precision! ðŸš€


```bash

cd zbench
  source venv/bin/activate
  python -m zbench.annotation_with_sage ../sample_dataset.jsonl
