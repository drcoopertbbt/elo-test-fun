These are universal principles that apply to virtually all types of machine learning models, not just neural networks. Early stopping is also mentioned, which is another broadly applicable technique. The emphasis on validation is particularly important because it helps detect overfitting, which is the first step in preventing it.\n\nWhen comparing these documents, both provide valuable information about preventing overfitting, but Document B offers more foundational and widely applicable principles.
